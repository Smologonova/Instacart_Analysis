# Instacart_Analysis
A data analytics project using Python to identify sales pattern based on Instacart data as a part of Data Analytics course at CareerFoundry.

## Objective
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
